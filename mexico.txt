The Doodle was designed by Doodler Emily Barrera, according to Google. She said in an interview about the Doodle, which can be seen above, 
“Alebrijes and cartonería are very iconic and representative of Mexican culture. I was delighted to create a whimsical alebrije for Pedro Linares’ Doodle. 
It also felt really rewarding to do something that is strongly tied to Mexico, making me feel more connected to my country. 
I find it very magical and satisfying to make an alebrije from scratch,
using your imagination, several simple household materials and your hands to make a physical object. 
Working on this alebrije made me admire even more the beautiful work of all the cartoneros in Mexico.”
